#My project is an app that helps elementary school students sign up for after-school enrichment classes. Students allowed to take up to two free classes during the school year, and they can choose to take them either both in the fall, both in the spring, or one in each trimester. There are five types of classes offered each trimester: Art, Dance, Scratch, Basketball, and Lego. Each class has a mentor assigned to lead it. Enrollments - up to 30.

#The app has three types of users:
#Admins, who manage the system, add students data, add class offerings, and assign mentors.
#Mentors, who can view the list of students in their classes.
#Students, who can log in and enroll themselves in the classes they are interested in.
